G'Day MotherFuckers, I'm a 60+yo Aussie bloke with 40+ years of Motorcycling experience, and experiences.
Riding Motorcycles is one of the best ways I can spend spare time.
In my 40+ years riding, I have not only ridden literally dozens of different motorcycles.
From a Harley Davidson 42 WLA, through to a Harley Electra Glides, and right through to Blockhead Softails.
Many of the Harleys i rode were customised, from a few 'Factory Extras' right through to Choppers, Baggers and many other names...
